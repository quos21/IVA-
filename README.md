We have built a virtual assistant using Python's speech to text module.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned
with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require
human intelligence.
It can also be termed as the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines,
especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems,
natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) we are building an artificial assistant whose
fundamental job would be to provide ease to users in performing similar tasks. An
example of such system would be Amazon Alexa, also known simply as Alexa, is a
virtual assistant technology largely based on a Polish speech synthesiser named Ivona,
bought by Amazon in 2013. It was first used in the Amazon Echo smart speaker and
the Echo Dot, Echo Studio and Amazon Tap speakers developed by Amazon Lab126.
It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms,
streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and
other real-time information, such as news. Alexa can also control several smart
devices using itself as a home automation system. Users are able to extend the Alexa
capabilities by installing "skills" (additional functionality developed by third-party
vendors, in other settings more commonly called apps) such as weather programs and
audio features. It uses automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and
other forms of weak AI to perform these tasks.
